## Patrick Collison, Stripe

### Summary

- **Founders aren't gods**. Patrick remembers going to Startup School and wondering how to become like the people on stage, too. You can do it.
- Startups are strange and counterintuitive:
  - Insanely high growth rates.
  - Good companies are often ignored and seem like bad ideas; otherwise, someone would've done them.
  - Very few people know what startups are actually like: the hopeless late night arguments, the "why aren't we growing" discussions, etc.
- Favourite lesson: **start out by making 100 users really happy**, rather than a lot more users only a little happy. (from Paul Buchheit.)
- Getting to even 1 user took them 6 months. A year and a half in, their transaction volume looked like nothing. They were in production beta for 19 months before launching.
- They slowly got traction by focussing on getting the YC batches using them.
- **Make users extremely happy**. Stripe were fanatical about this: if someone in the dev chatroom didn't get a response within 30 secs, the whole team's phones would ring.
- **"Eventually, after a couple of years, Stripe started to become an overnight success."**
- Stripe aims to become the economic infrastructure of the internet, to enable loads of other commerce. Similar to how shipping containers made shipping costs irrelevant in physical goods.

### Raw notes

Felt some amount of 'imposter syndrome' - felt like they were cut from a different cloth; they're not.
There's a lot that is strange about startups:
1. Where else in the world do you see growth rates & change of that amount?
2. Companies that take off are counterintuitive, otherwise someone would've already done it. Good co's want to be underestimated.
3. Startups are new; few people get to see them up close. People tell stories and focus on rocket ships etc, late night arguments, why aren't we growing, etc. Even the very successful startups go through this.

Even Facebook wasn't obvious initially, 6 months into the company's history.

How did growth feel from Stripe's perspective?

All the other co's handling payments seemed to be complete dinosaurs. Seemed obvious that there should be a payments platform for the internet.

"It won't be that hard and It probably won't take that long" - JohnCollison

starting a co with your brother is a good idea; decades of experience building things. Cofounder departures, tension, arguments. Normal.

Originally called /dev/payments. Idea was that API should be straightforward.

Decided to target makers. Payments as a technology problem; much more that you could do for users.

At uni at the time; worked nights & weekends on this.

Moved to Buenos Aires; cheap, firendly, wifi everywhere, nothing starts before noon; "an entire city on the programmer schedule"

If you want to get something done, think about Buenos Aires.

Got one of their friends using it initially.

'0 to 1'.

Tech side is fine but finance industry is a nightmare. Had a lot of meetings where it was like "so, how does payments work?"

Highly recommends moving to the US for their startup. Empirically the Valley maximises your chances of success.

John used to sleep in the garden most nights because there wasn't any ACs. Early days are always writing code or talking to users; anything else wastes time.

First 6 months, no transaction volume.

Raised first investment from Peter Thiel. "Luckily, Peter Thiel is crazy"

"Working all the time"

Brainstormed names, couldn't think of a good one; choosing between Stripe and PayDaemon.

Couldn't think of a word, so had to pick a deadline for the name.

A couple of YC startups had started using Stripe; extremely low still at the start of the 1st year.

Spent a few weeks in Rio hacking away.

"Invite-only private beta = baby blanket of stratups" - launch! THat said, the beta period was really useful for Stripe

Start out by making 100 users really happy. rather than a lot mroe users only a little happy.  (Buchheit)

Changed their code so that anyone got any error, they would immediately fix it no matter what; made users extremely happy.

IMing with an engineer is the best support expereince possible. Open chatroom.

Hooked chatroom up to paging system so if someone didn't get a resopnse within 30 seconds it rang everyone. Were really serious about user experience.

Weren't just building a think software layer; wanted to be able to define the complete experience. The infrastructure for internet commerce. Needed to work with banks - worked with Wells Fargo (really hard to get them to return emails, calls). Asked a friend, Geoff Ralston, to help out because he convinced record labels to work with him.

"Negotiating with a bank while your office is filling with water"

You're constantly wondering whether it is a good idea. Self-doubt: maybe I'm not the one who can pull this off.

That never really goes away. Greg Lemond: "it doesn't get easier, you just go faster"

19 months in production use before they launched. Transaction volume kind of promising signs, kept going.

"Eventually, after a couple of years, Stripe strated to become an overnight success."

It takes a really long time for things to start to work, even if you are onto something.
6 --> 150 people.

Transport costs before shipping containers accounted for 25% of the cost of a physical good. The invention of the shipping container basically eliminated the cost. Reduced the cost of loading/unloading by 95%. It's better to assume that moving goods is "essentially costless"

This created an enormous role for Singapore, Korea, other shipping hubs.

Good tech facilitates further structural changes.

"Economic infrastructure for the internet"

Innovation "the sum of the changes across the system"

To "increase the GDP of the internet"

The vast majority of the time they are not thinking about those problems. The detail vs. the vision.

## Adora Cheung, Homejoy

Mission to make homes happier everywhere

London & Berlin are on the cusp of something great. SV has time on its side.

Definitely advises to go to the Valley.

"How not to die" (in the startup context)

Her and Aaron spent a really long time searching for Homejoy - over 3 years. "Utter mess and darkness".

Before they even thought of Homejoy.

Wanted to (1) make people happier somehow (2) wanted to build a huge business. Good proxy for impact.

Work on a problem you actually have.

Issue was that they didn't own many things, are simple people, and a mattress, and that's it. Didn't have amny problems. !

Had to go search for a problem.

Needle in a haystack. Some people are very good at it. "Taking each piece of hay - is this hay or needle?"

Need to be extremely patient.

Started Pathjoy in 2009. A platform that connected people to therapists and life coaches. "When we tried the platform ourselves, we hated it and couldn't stand to use the sessions."

Went through idea after idea. Went through a dozen ideas for over 3 years. Had to get a generator to pay electrical bills. Typical Asian-America parents, were about to disown them and were just flailing around instead of working at high paying jobs!

Found herself writging a network of blogs. Convinced herself that when people read entertainment news, get this little bit of joy times a million.

But that doesn't work for her. Faking ti at that point.

By 2012, didn't have an idea still. Running out of money. Had raised a bit of money but it was pretty much gone.

Were walking out of Aaron's place; place was extremely dirty; "maybe I should just go find a cleaner"

Finding a cleaner was extremely difficult! Looked up cleaning agencies, and the problem was that the agencies collected a huge premium for that. Online classifieds were the other option but you had no idea if the cleaners were any good.

They found a problem that they had! Decided to start working on Homejoy.

Long path for them to even make it somewhat successful.

The first problem they had was how do they find customers. Spun up a website, opened it up, and of course 0 people.

Couldn't find a customer.

A fair outside, gave people free water bottles in hot water, and basically guilt tripped them into booking cleanings! Surprisingly, people didn't cancel the cleanings, so decided that this was actually a problem.

Chicken & egg problem. Focussed on the customer side and just became cleaners themselves.

Learned v quickly that they were very bad cleaners, and that cleaning is hard. Could take many many hours.

One of the houses they cleaned was 9,000 sq ft. Post construction clean. Lots of dust. Layers and layers of dust.

Turns out you need special equipment to clean the dust. Took them 5 days to clean the damn house. Worst experience for the customer!

So they thought they have to look legit, which means learning to clean themlselves first.
Learn by doing. Got a job at a cleaning company. (Was rejected almost everywhere).SF 30-90 min drive; show up at 7-8am, go out and clean all day, then come back, drive back down to MV, shower, etc. Eventually decided to sleep in her car to save time commuting. So focussed on learning how to clean.

Learned a lot about how a typical cleaning company worked: getting a customer, booking a customer, etc.

Were very confident at this point that they were onto something; by doing it themselves they realised there was alot you could do to imrpveo it.

Confident that actual professional cleaners would join and they wouldn't have to clean as much.

Next problem: had no money in the bank.

If they didn't raise capital they wouldn't be able to grow as fast.

Raising capital was a nightmare. Hadn't gotten anywhere in 3 years.

Aaron started practicing poker.

Set up 2 meetings. If they didn't go well, they were just going to spin the company down.
One was Max Levchin. The second was office hours with PG.

Was it all for nothing? Asked for $25k - "oh, that's it?!" Gave it to them straightaway.

PG also gave them $25k.

At that point, $50k felt like a LOT.

Now 150 employees, $40m+ in VC, 30 countries. Living the dream that she imagined so many years
ago today.

How did you keep on going? How not to quit? Answer: Aaron and her are pretty simple and don't stress out about things. A lot fo crap happens. You can't make a stressful situation more stressful. "How am I going to deal with this?" You can survive.

You only fail if you stop trying. So if you don't give up, you won't have failed.

Luck is a bunch of crap. Sure, there are lucky events in your life. She got lucky because the best cofounder was her brother. Otherwise, they have completely worked their assess off and continued to do so. Works literally every single day to make Homejoy better.

You need to work really really hard. And smart.

## Ian Hogarth, Songkick

Over 10m unique visits per month.

Spotify, Pandora, and Songkick. (Music, radio, concerts)

Built the company for 7 years. Rewires your intuitions about startups.


Like watching the first season of 24 after going through all 8 seasions. Competitors disappear.

See competitors valued at $1b, $10bn, etc.  Crazy exponential curve.

Summer 2007. 22 co's in their YC batch. Most of the others got shut down or acquired for small amounts of money.

Makes you internalise how hard it is.

"Pretty much everyone was better tan us"

Intimitated by Disqus.

...And then there was Dropbox.

1. Music startups are demorialising
2. Understand the game
3. Don't give up.

Caldwell, Parker, Ralston, Goldberg, Patten, Patrovi... music startup founders.

Taste is narrower than you think

A small # creators drive most activity/revenue

Creators --> middlemen

Middlemen increasingly consolidate rights

Need alignment with middlemen

(So, why now?) Grow Hollywood or die

"If you're a musician and your career fails, you can't just give up and go join Radiohead"

If consolidated, align with power players (e.g. banks); if fragmented e.g. taxis, you can disrupt them.

Portfolio theory: startups aren't a great idea in rationality terms. The main reason to build a startup is that you're really motivated to solve a problem and the satisfaction of solving it justifies 5-10 years of failure and stress, much of which will be out of your control.

3 engines:
1. Gratification
2. Growth
3. Economic

1\. Gratification = "make something people want". Pretty brutal for Songkick; scraped ticket sites + a Mac app. Get a list of concerts in your area based on the music you listen to. Pretty lame first-time use. Return on the 5 mins of your life was that list of shows. Some people were willing to do it, but the friction involved was too high for most people.

Added lots of additional features that resulted in v little usage.

Started running surveys into why the people who loved it, did love it; and vice versa. The bottom line was that personalised concert alerts was gratifying. People found shows that they would never have gotten to. But too few users would get into it. Needed to radically improve the ease of getting to that experience.

Once you find something that works, do the incremental work that improves the gratifying experience.

For SK, this was getting better concert data. Hard to solve this problem, but worth doing: users would realise that you had every single show. Data was the linchpin.

2\. Growth

No chance of starting nuless you have a great gratifying experience. 4 main ways for consumer: WOM/Viral (Snapchat, FB), Paid (Zynga, Airbnb) SEO (Yelp, Wikipedia, RapGenius), API/widget (YT, soundcloud, twitter).

For SK, the first big insight there was no canonical page for artists/concerts, i.e. IMDB. You get SEO, social referrals, etc if you make the canonical page.

Mobile app stores reward a gratifying experience more than any other platform in history.

3\. Economic - how do you make money from your users.

Still a WIP. Set up affiliate deals initially with ticketing companies. Similar to Kayak etc.

Taken them to $m's, but not X00m's. Optimal revenue model is selling the tickets. Needs industry partnerships and econmic alignment with the people who hold the rgihts. 25% of all concerts inLondon, you can buy through SK.

All of these 3 things depend on each other.

How to develop your resilience:
- It usually does get better if you keep going.
- Dec 2010, nothing felt like it was working; brutal board meeting; so miserable that whole Christmas. Low point.
- Growth had been tanking.
- Same point is just before a bunch of things just atarted to work.
- "Survival is a growth strategy."
- New startups get built when new platforms emerge; e.g. Shazam and Pandora were 8 and 7 years old when the iPone laucnhed, and the iPhone basically doubled their growth overnight.
- Understand why you are doing this. What is the passion?
- When you're low, refer yourself back to the 'why'. You earnestly want to solve a problem.
- Spend some time with your users.
- Start the company with people you can really count on. Build on top of a long-standing and trusting relationship.
